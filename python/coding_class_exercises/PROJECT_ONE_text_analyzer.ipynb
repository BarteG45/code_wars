    "#### Project Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write a Python script to analyze the word frequency in a text file. The script will read a text file, clean the text by removing punctuation and converting all words to lowercase, and then count the occurrences of each word. Finally, it will print out the list of words along with their frequencies in descending order.\n",

    "Read the text from a file.\n",
    "Convert all text to lowercase.\n",
    "Remove punctuation characters from the text. You can create a list of punctuation characters to remove.\n",
    "Count the occurrences of each word in the cleaned text.\n",
    "Store the word frequencies in a dictionary.\n",
    "For extra credit you can try to return the dictionary in an ordered way, descending (from most common to least common) using methods you got acquainted with during the course.\n",

    "**Output**:\n",

    "Print the list of words along with their frequencies.\n",
